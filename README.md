Bike Sales Analysis & Dashboard â€“ Excel Project

This project explores a Bike Buyers dataset to understand which factors influence customer purchasing decisions.

Cleaned and standardized raw data (marital status, gender, age brackets, etc.) for consistency.
Built a working sheet with calculated columns (e.g., Age Group segmentation).
Created pivot tables to analyze income, demographics, and purchase patterns.
Designed an interactive Excel Dashboard that visualizes:
  Average income of bike buyers vs. non-buyers
  Purchase behavior segmented by gender, age, and region
  Commute distance vs. likelihood of purchase
